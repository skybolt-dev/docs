## Getting Started

After signing up, you will be redirected to the dashboard. From there, you can manage your subscription and access your API keys.

Using your API key, you can start making requests to the Skybolt API. There are two primary WebSocket endpoints available:

- **/wss/global**: This endpoint provides access to global realtime lightning data.
- **/wss/conus**: This endpoint provides access to realtime lightning data for the continental United States.

These endpoints are documented in detail in the [API Reference](/api-reference/websockets/lightningdataglobal).

#### Connection Limits

Users on the Personal plan are limited to 1 concurrent WebSocket connection. Users on the Professional plan may create unlimited concurrent WebSocket connections.

There are no limits on the number of events sent over the WebSocket connection.

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests. The header should look like this:

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```
